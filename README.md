# NewMailGenerator
A project aiming to create a new weekly mail generator for helping me as a publicist.

ToDo: A lot of, for example:
- GUI
- Exporting weekly mails
- Weekly mail layout
- Web page layout
- Testing
- Switching amount of possible registrations to a global variable (controllers/registration.js)
- Order bulletins by month -> day ...
- Implement a better system to check dates
- Consider if signup can be open after the date of the bulletin (ie. the signup ending date can be adter the date of the bulletin)
- Add possibility to change date/signup start/end of a bulletin
- Categories are not hardcoded (bulletins.js & bulletindata.eta) (create a list of valid categories and check if the item is not included in)
- Adding bulletins to weekly mails
- Organizing or filtering bulletins for given category
- Add possibility to remove bulletins from weekly mails
- Languages (Finnish and English) wouldn't be that hardcoded
- Add correct charset
- Add possibility to remove bulletins
- Add possibility to remove weekly mails
- Enable HTML tags to greetings and messages (works when they're fetch from database)
- And so on...
