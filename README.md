# NewMailGenerator
A project aiming to create a new weekly mail generator for helping me as a publicist.

ToDo: A lot of, for example:
- GUI
- Exporting weekly mails
- Adding bulletins
- Adding new weekly mails
- Weekly mail layout
- Web page layout
- Testing
- Switching amount of possible registrations to a global variable (controllers/registration.js)
- Order bulletins by month -> day ...
- Implement a better system to check dates
- Consider if signup can be open after the date of the bulletin
- And so on...
