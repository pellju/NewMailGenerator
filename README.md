# NewMailGenerator
A project aiming to create a new weekly mail generator for helping me as a publicist.

ToDo: A lot of, for example:
- Application itself:
    - GUI:
        - Layout
    - Testing
    - Switching amount of possible registrations to a global variable (controllers/registration.js)
    - Cleaning and imporving the code

- Mails:
    - Improve functions used for mail exportation
    - Create links for subjects found in the version which will be uploaded to web site 

- Bulletins:
    - Ordering bulletins by month --> day (in /bulletins)
    - Add possibility to change date/signup start/end of a bulletin
    - Categories are not hardcoded (bulletins.js & bulletindata.eta) (create a list of valid categories and check if the item is not included in)
    - Organizing or filtering bulletins for given category
    - Languages (Finnish and English) wouldn't be that hardcoded
